Gains of the Axoclamp 2B
------------------------

H is Headstage Current Gain

Im          10/H mV/nA
I2          10/H mV/nA
0.1 x I2    1/H mV/nA

Ext VC      20 mV/V
Ext ME1     10 x H nA/V
Ext ME2     10 x H nA/V

10 Vm       10 mV/mV
V2          mV/mV


There are also other ones, include bridge resistance, etc.

Model cell Clamp-1U: electrode is 50 MOhm, cell is 50 MOhm / 500 pF
