Notes on clamper
----------------
Script-based electrophysiology in Python.

TODO:

* Automatic compensation in voltage-clamp?
* Two channel settings
* continuous acquisition (direct to disk)
* virtual devices with Brian model

Processing and tools:
* AEC, bridge
* DCC
* Offline analysis tools (see in Brian 1)
* Signal generators (just produce arrays)

Meta-data:
* Store the info from the MCC (resistance, bridge etc) + date and time etc

Technical aspects:
* Is there a limit to the length of recordings? (on the board)
  If so, we should use continuous acquisition.

Brian:
* It should be easy to connect to Brian in continuous acquisition mode!
    > we don't need real time, just blocking run and large enough dt (pre-estimate)
* Virtual board and amplifier to run on a Brian model
